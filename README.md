  EvilJL is a utility tool that aims to make working with Julia just a little bit harder! <br>
  EvilJL modifies your Julia files to make them unreadable, stupid, and even just outright break them! Not the tool we needed, but the tool we deserved.<br><br>
  To use EvilJL, clone the repo, and use the package manager to `add` it. It is a fully functional, standalone package, so Pkg will recognise it as one. You could, alternatively, use Pkg to `add` a link to this repo.
